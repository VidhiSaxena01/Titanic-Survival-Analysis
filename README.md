# Titanic-Survival-Analysis
In this project, I have used the Titanic dataset to analyze the survival factors. While the data is full of numbers and categories, I wanted to ensure that each data point is treated with respect, as behind every statistic was a real personâ€”a life filled with dreams, hopes, and in many cases, a story that ended too soon.
